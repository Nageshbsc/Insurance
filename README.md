📊 Insurance Data Analysis Project

🧾 Project Overview


This project focuses on analyzing insurance customer data using Python and popular data analysis libraries.
The main goal is to understand how different factors like age, gender, BMI, children, smoking habits, and region affect insurance charges.

This project is useful for:

Beginners in Data Analytics

Students working on college projects

Interview preparation

Understanding real-world datasets
